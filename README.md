# Secondary-Structure-Prediction-Tool-using-Chou-Fasman-method
The primary objective of this project is to implement and evaluate the Chou-Fasman algorithm for predicting the secondary structure of proteins. The project will focus on using amino acid sequences to predict regions likely to form alpha-helices, beta-sheets, and random coils, based on the propensities of amino acids to adopt specific structural conformations.

This Project focuses on making the process easy to get the predicted Secondary Structure of protein by only taking the name of the protein and taxonomy type as input the options are given to choose any of the amino acid sequences and get the output. It also accepts the amino acid sequence.
